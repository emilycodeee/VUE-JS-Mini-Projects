# VUE JS Mini-Project

As a React developer and I want to stick with React js. But I think a good frontend developer need to familiar with at least 2-3 frameworks. So Iâ€™m planning to learn it.

The whole list below is kind of my learning phase. I will list every project I have learned and tutorial link below. And thanks to every tutorial on youtube.
